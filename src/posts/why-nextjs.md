If you are someone who is building a website or web application, you may have heard of Next.js.
It's a popular React framework that is becoming increasingly popular for a variety of reasons.
In this blog post, we'll explore why you should start your project with Next.js.

## Improved performance

Next.js optimizes your website by splitting your code and assets so that only the necessary code is loaded, which helps to reduce load times.
Next.js also comes with built in server side rendering (SSR), which means that your website will be pre-rendered serverside.

## Scalability

Next.js is a highly scalable framework that is designed to handle websites and web applications of all sizes. Its scalability is due to a variety of factors, including its built-in performance optimizations, its support for server-side rendering (SSR), and its ability to handle high traffic websites and web applications.

### Conclusion

Next.js is a popular choice for developers who want to build websites or web applications with React, as it integrates seamlessly with the React library.

Overall, if you are a web developer who is looking to build modern, scalable, and high-performing websites or web applications, Next.js is definitely worth considering.
